# 2950 lines of Javascript AI - An MIT Battlecode 2019 Writeup

It's that time of the year again! A month-long constant grind to achieve the invaluable experience of travelling to MIT and glorious fame of (owait there is prize money too ;o). For the past few years, I have participated in Battlecode, but I had never written any sort of writeup. It was only until Cixelyn (Cory Li, MIT 2012, @Cixelyn), a previous winner of battlecode (and also wrote a fascinating post mortem link here), protested that we should write more post mortems.

Quite frankly, I simply did not have anything interesting to write about in previous years, and thus did not pursue any sort of writeup. However, this year, although we (spoilers) did not win, it certainly has been an adventurous journey in not only programming our bot, but also in socializing with the devs and other teams at the finals.
